"""
Code to compute draws for a mixed logit model. Consists of functions that return nvar x ndraws matrices.
These seem like they should be transposed, but they will be accessed one draw at a time in estimating, and
Julia stores matrices in Fortran (column-major) order.
"""

"""
Draws objects define methods to get draws. Methods:

getdraw(Draws, coef_index, group_index, draw_index)

where coef_index is which random coefficient, group_index is which group
(individual or observation), and draw_index is which draw.

getdraw() returns a float between 0 and 1 exclusive, which can be passed to quantile to get draws with a particular distribution.

getdraw() is pure, and should be deterministic even on different machine types (to allow for distributed computation).
